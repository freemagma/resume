# Employment

### Capital One
Software Engineering Intern, Summer 2021
* In Progress

### Leidos AI/ML Accelerator
Software Engineering Intern, Summer 2020
* Researched xRCA (Extended Rapid Class Augmentation),
                a progressive learning technique to augment new classes
                onto a model without using data from old classes
* Developed a novel and general technique for stabilizing xRCA
                initialization accuracy on few data
* **Built with: Pytorch, Numpy, Jupyter, AWS**

### Leidos
Software Engineering Intern, Summer 2019
* Researched techniques for fully homomorphic encryption over machine learning models
* Tested and benchmarked homomorphic encryption libraries (SEAL, Palisade, nGraph-HE)
* **Built with: Tensorflow, Docker**

### Blackboiler
Software Engineering Intern, Summer 2018
* Developed natural language processing solutions to aid automated contract review
* Clustered legal documents into semantic groups using
                unsupervised machine learning techniques
* **Built with: SpaCy, Scikit Learn**

### CS 2110: Computer Organization & Programming
Teaching Assistant, Fall 2020 -- Present

# Projects & Research

### [Mendax](https://github.com/quinquice/mendax/blob/main/paper/main.pdf)
Deep Learning Research Project, Fall 2020
* Trained a set of networks to communicate with eachother, split into adverserial teams
                of "liars" and "truthtellers" in a situation inspired by Among Us
* Explored the conditions in which networks were able to
                distinguish "liars" from "truthtellers"
* **Built with: Pytorch, Numpy**

### [Geoverify](https://github.com/quinquice/geoverify)
Research Project, Aug. 2018 -- June 2019
* Haskell library (and command line interface) for manipulating and verifying geometry proofs
* The library can parse and understand both simple arithmetic and geometric propositions, and supports
                extension by means of postulates and theorems
* **Built with: Haskell (MTL, Lens, Transformers), PostgreSQL, Django**

* Uses custom-built ML models to generate relevant presentation slides, complete with titles, text summary, and images
* **Built with: SpaCy, Pytorch, FastText, Django**

### VTHacks
1st Place Overall, Mar. 2019
* Created [Electromotivated](https://github.com/ovkulkarni/electromotivated),
                a website that automatically parses and analyzes pictures of circuits using computer vision and graph algorithms
* **Built with: OpenCV, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Django**
